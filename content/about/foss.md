Free and open-source software (FOSS) is software that is released under a
license that allows users to freely use, modify, and redistribute it. At Dense
Analysis we believe that software ought to be as free from restrictions as is
humanly possible. By growing free software, we give back to the universe around
us, and strengthen our capabilities as human beings.

Proprietary software stands in opposition to free software, though we at Dense
Analysis take a practical approach. We hold a firm belief that all software
should be free, but do not protest violently where it is not. Such a fight is
not necessary, for we believe on a long enough timeline **FOSS always wins**.
Unrestricted software enables longevity and fosters ease of access, whereas
proprietary software permits the authors to control the users and denies users
the right to make their own modifications.

FOSS is more reliable than proprietary software. FOSS is developed by a
community of developers who are constantly working to improve the software and
fix any bugs or issues, wherever that software remains relevant. Since the
source code is open, anyone can contribute to the development of the software,
which helps to ensure that any issues are quickly addressed. Where software
loses relevance to the general public, any capable person can take the source
code and modify it to function as they see fit, and the software can be
maintained in this manner _in perpetuity_.
