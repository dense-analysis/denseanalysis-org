Dense Analysis is back with a short tip for anyone who wants to launch ChatGPT straight from the browser address bar.

If you use a Chromium-based browser like Chrome, Edge, Brave, or Thorium, you can set up ChatGPT as a custom search engine. This means that anything you type into the address bar will open a ChatGPT conversation using your text as the prompt.

## 1. Open Search Engine Settings

* Open the browser settings menu.
* Navigate to **Search Engine** > **Manage search engines and site search** (use the settings search bar if necessary).

## 2. Add a Site Search Entry

Create a new site search entry with the following values:

* **Name**: `ChatGPT`
* **Shortcut**: `chatgpt`
* **URL with %s in place of query**: `https://chatgpt.com/?q=%s`

Save the entry when you are done.

## 3. Set ChatGPT as the Default

Click the menu beside the entry you just created and select **Make default**. Now, typing anything in the address bar will start a ChatGPT session with your query.

## Notes

* Your browser may still show history suggestions as you type. Clear browsing history if you want to avoid that.
* GPT-4o is used automatically if you have a Plus or Team subscription.
* To run a live web search, type "search the web for [your query]" in the ChatGPT window or press the **Search the web** button if it appears.

## Reminder

ChatGPT does not index the web like a traditional search engine. Verify anything important from original sources.
