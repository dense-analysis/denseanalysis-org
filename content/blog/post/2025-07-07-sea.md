Our [previous post](/post/2025-06-01-chatgpt-default-search-engine/)
explained how to make ChatGPT your search engine.
Search Engine Adapter (SEA) builds on that idea.

SEA is a lightweight nginx proxy that chooses between Google, the ChatGPT API,
or Wikipedia based on keywords in your query.
It compiles nginx config files from a simple TOML source using Go, resulting in
a small and secure deployment.

## Key Features

* Dynamic keyword routing with nginx's `map` directive
* One HTTPS endpoint easily secured with Let's Encrypt
* Minimal dependencies and small attack surface

You can configure SEA using `config-example.toml`, then compile the final
`nginx.conf`. Once deployed, every search is forwarded to the matching service.

A live instance is available at <https://search.denseanalysis.org/?q=%s> for
anyone who wants to try it.

The project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/dense-analysis/sea). We
welcome feedback and contributions.
