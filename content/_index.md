Welcome to Dense Analysis. We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization focused on
building Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) plus IT education and training.
We believe that everyone should have access to the tools and knowledge they need
to make informed decisions about their lives and the world around them. We make
it a little bit easier to understand the complexity of the world around us
through tooling and education.

We invite you to join us on our mission to make the world a better place through
technology. Together, we can make a difference, whether that's by writing code
or just by speaking our minds.
